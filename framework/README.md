# CS272: Geometric Modeling

This is a viewer application, using [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org), [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui), and [OpenMesh](https://www.openmesh.org), and based on the [libigl](https://libigl.github.io) viewer.

You will need to install the following packages:

 * `$ pip install numpy`
 * `$ pip install glfw`
 * `$ pip install imgui[full]`
 * `$ pip install numba numpy-quaternion`
 * `$ pip install openmesh`

You can use this viewer as the basis for your program. But remember, **all other code you submit must be your own work**.
